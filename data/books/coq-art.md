description: >
  Coq'Art is the familiar name for the first book on the Rocq Prover (at the time called Coq) and its underlying theory the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
recommendation: >
  This textbook is a foundational book that introduces readers to the Rocq Prover and its underlying formal system, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC).
  The book provides a comprehensive guide to interactive theorem proving, combining theory with practical applications. It covers key concepts such as inductive types, recursive functions, and proof construction, while offering numerous examples and case studies, including the formalization of algorithms and mathematical proofs. Coq'Art serves as both an introduction for beginners and a reference for experts, making it an essential resource for anyone working with Rocq or exploring formal methods.
